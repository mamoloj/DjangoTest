I want to create a django app that has a capability to
-list all the books
-what publisher has more than 1 author
    - sort by high revenue per author
    - sort the lowest rev. per author
-which author, highest revenue per page written
-list of all the books written by 1 author
    -publisher attached to that book, who has the most revenue
